I'll guide you through deploying your React portfolio project to Netlify. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

Method 1: Deploy via Git (Recommended)
Step 1: Prepare Your Project
First, make sure your project is ready for deployment. Let me check if you have a build script in your package.json:

Read package.json, lines 1 to 37

Perfect! Your project is a Vite-based React app with the correct build script. Now let's set it up for deployment:

Step 2: Push to GitHub (if not already done)
Initialize Git (if not already done):
Create a GitHub repository:

Go to GitHub.com
Click "New repository"
Name it: mohammed-azam-portfolio
Make it public
Don't initialize with README (since you already have files)
Push to GitHub:

Step 3: Deploy to Netlify
Go to Netlify:

Visit netlify.com
Sign up/Login (you can use your GitHub account)
Import from Git:

Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub
Select your mohammed-azam-portfolio repository
Configure Build Settings:

Branch to deploy: main
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
Click "Deploy site"
Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)
After deployment:

Go to Site settings → Domain management
Click "Add custom domain"
Enter your domain (e.g., mohammedazam.dev)
DNS Configuration:

Add these DNS records at your domain provider:
